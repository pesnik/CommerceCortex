    poetry run airflow webserver
    poetry run airflow scheduler
    ```

### Analytics and Models
- **Model Training**: Train AI models for recommendations, forecasting, and more.  
  - Example: Train a recommendation model:
    ```bash
    poetry run python analytics-models/recommendation/train.py
    ```
- **Model Evaluation**: Test performance with scripts in `/analytics-models/evaluation/`.

### Dashboards
- **BI Visualization**: Explore insights with Tableau, Power BI, or a custom Dash app.  
  - Start the Dash app:
    ```bash
